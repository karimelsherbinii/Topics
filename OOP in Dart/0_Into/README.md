### **Difference between Procedural Programming and Object-Oriented Programming:**

---

| Procedural Programming | Object-Oriented Programming: |
| --- | --- |
| Program is divided into small parts called functions | The program is divided into small parts called objects |
| follows top-down approach | follows a bottom-up approach. |
| No access | have access like private, public, protected, etc. |
| Adding new data and functions is not easy | adding new data and functions is so easy  |
| does not have any way proper way for hiding data so it is less secure. | provides data hiding so it is more secure. |
| overloading is not possible | is possible in OOP |
| a function is more important than data | data is more important than function |
| is based on an unreal world | is based on real-world |
| Examples: C, FORTRAN, Pascal, Basic | Examples: C++, Java, Python, C# |

### Introduction of Programming Paradigms:

---

**Imperative programming paradigm:**

- Overview
    - It is one of the oldest programming paradigms
    - a close relation to machine architecture.
    - It works by changing the program state through assignment statements.
    - The main focus is on how to achieve the goal.
- Advantages
    1. Very simple to implement
    2. It contains loops, variables, etc.
- Disadvantage**:**
    1. A complex problem cannot be solved
    2. Less efficient and less productive
    3. Parallel programming is not possible
- Examples
    
    **`C`, `Fortran`, `Basic**`
    
- Code
    
    ```c
    // average of five number in C
    int marks[5] = { 12, 32, 45, 13, 19 } int sum = 0;
    float average = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    sum = sum + marks[i];
    }
    average = sum / 5;
    ```
    

**Declarative programming paradigm:**

- Overview
    - divided as Logic, Functional, Database.
    - It may simplify writing parallel programs.
    - The focus is on what needs to be done rather than how it should be done basically emphasizing what code is actually doing.
